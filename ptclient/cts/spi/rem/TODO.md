1. When I hit submit the form and the form was submittingf and then i entered and saved again. The system got confused.
   Ref: https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/1010

2. Change id 2 that creates id 3 and then change id 3 line 203 of c.vue - DONE

3. Discontniue and multi discontinue need a response if it was success or not. - DONE

4. Form field focus and arrow keys to traverse the sytem using v-on a system that is common like rowstatus.js

Step 1: Every ct when they are invoked in search an entry is made in vst-of-cards-in-cs-of-vl:arCards

Each component when mounted will ask vl-search-box about its sequence in the arCards

baseNumber = arrayPosition \* 100 = 0

then internally each box gets tabIdex as basenumber+1,basenumber+2,basenumber+3,basenumber+4

Support rex is arrayPosition = 1
baseNumber = arrayPosition \* 100 = 100
then internally each box gets tabIdex as basenumber+1,basenumber+2,basenumber+3,basenumber+4

Low priority:

1. In default.json i set config.artificial_delay_in_response_from_node_server=0 but it is not taking effect.
